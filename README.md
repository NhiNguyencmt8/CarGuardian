# CGuard


CGuard is an inexpensive, portable anti-theft device that detects suspicious activity when the driver is not in the car. Our long-term goal is to reduce car theft in the Worcester community by cheaply mass-producing this device and distributing it widely. In this hackathon, we aim to show a proof of concept of this device where we show that an Arduino board, acoustic sensor, accelerometer, GPS, and GSM module is all thatâ€™s needed for a comprehensive and inexpensive anti-theft tool.
